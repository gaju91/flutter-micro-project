# Flutter Micro Apps - Learn by Doing

**Philosophy**: Learn Flutter by building real, useful apps. No theory-heavy lectures. Just code, build, understand.

## 🎯 What This Is

**8 progressive micro apps** that teach Flutter from scratch through hands-on building.

- ✅ **No prerequisites** - Start from zero
- ✅ **Learn by doing** - Build real apps, not toy examples
- ✅ **Progressive** - Each app introduces new concepts
- ✅ **Standalone** - Complete in itself, no external courses needed
- ✅ **Practical** - Apps you can actually use

## 🎓 Learning Approach

### Build → Understand → Master

1. **Read the guide** for the app (in micro-apps-curriculum.md)
2. **Create Flutter project** for that app
3. **Code step-by-step** following the guide
4. **Test frequently** to see your progress
5. **Understand every line** - ask questions, experiment
6. **Move to next app** - builds on what you just learned

### No Prerequisites

Start at App 1 even if you've never written Dart or Flutter before. The curriculum teaches you everything as you build.

---

## ⏱️ Time Investment

- **Each app**: 45-120 mins
- **Total**: ~10 hours
- **Recommended pace**: 1-2 apps per week
- **Result**: Solid Flutter foundation in 1 month
